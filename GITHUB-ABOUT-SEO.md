# How to Update Your GitHub Repo "About" for SEO

The **About** section (right sidebar on your repo) is heavily used by GitHub search and search engines. Update it as follows.

---

## Where to Edit

1. Open your repo on GitHub.
2. In the **right sidebar**, find the **About** section.
3. Click the **gear icon** (⚙️) next to "About".
4. Edit **Description**, **Website**, and **Topics**; then click **Save changes**.

## SEO-Optimized Description (copy-paste)

GitHub allows **up to 350 characters**. Use one of these:

### Option A (short, ~200 chars)

```
Pump.fun & Four.meme smart contract forks: Solana meme coin launchpad (Rust/Anchor, Raydium/Meteora) and BNB Chain launchpad (Solidity, PancakeSwap). Bonding curve, DEX migration, token factory.
```

### Option B (keyword-rich, ~320 chars)

```
Open-source meme coin launchpad smart contracts: Pump.fun-style on Solana (Rust, Anchor, Raydium, Meteora) and Four.meme-style on BNB Chain (Solidity, PancakeSwap). Bonding curve, token factory, DEX migration. Production-ready DeFi reference implementation.
```

## Website

Keep or set:

```
https://solpumpf-demo.vercel.app
```

(Use `https://` so it’s clickable.)

---

## Topics (tags)

Topics improve discovery on GitHub and act as keywords. **Fix:** use `launchpad` (not `lanchpad`).

**Suggested list:**

- `launchpad`
- `smart-contracts`
- `solana`
- `bnb-chain`
- `pumpfun`
- `fourmeme`
- `raydium`
- `meteora`
- `pancakeswap`
- `bonding-curve`
- `defi`
- `meme-token`
- `token-2022`
- `solidity`
- `anchor-framework`
- `rust`

Remove or avoid: `lanchpad`, duplicate/typo tags like `pumpf`, `pump-f`, `pumpdotf` (keep one: `pumpfun`).

---

## Quick checklist

- [ ] Description under 350 chars, no repetitive phrases
- [ ] Website URL with `https://`
- [ ] Topics: fix `lanchpad` → `launchpad`, add key terms (solana, bnb-chain, defi, bonding-curve, etc.)
- [ ] README first line and first paragraph already keyword-rich (you have this)

After saving, the About section will better match searches like “pump.fun clone”, “Solana launchpad”, “four.meme BNB”, and “meme coin smart contract”.
